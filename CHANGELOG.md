### Features
- **Main Endpoint (`/`)**: Returns welcome message
- **Health Endpoint (`/health`)**: Comprehensive health status with:
  - Application uptime
  - Memory usage statistics (RSS, heap used, heap total)
  - Environment information
  - ISO timestamp
- **Sleep Endpoint (`/sleep`)**: Configurable delay for testing
- **Request Logging**: Automatic logging with:
  - Unique request IDs
  - Start/end timestamps
  - Response times
  - HTTP status codes

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Multi-stage build with Node.js 18 Alpine
- **Kubernetes**: Production-ready manifests with:
  - Deployment with 2 replicas
  - Service with LoadBalancer

  - Resource limits and requests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow with:
  - Automated testing
  - Docker image building
  - ECR registry push
  - EKS deployment
  - Load testing validation
  - Performance regression detection

### Testing
- **k6 Load Tests**:
  - Basic load test: 50 VUs for 30 seconds
  - Enhanced test: Multiple scenarios and user profiles
  - Slow endpoint test: Network latency simulation
  - Performance thresholds: <500ms p95, 0% error rate

### Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Built-in readiness and liveness probes
- **Metrics**: Memory usage, uptime, response times
- **Alerting**: Performance regression detection
- **Logging**: Structured request/response logging

### Security
- **OIDC Integration**: Secure AWS authentication
